# Deep Learning Engineering Interview Task

This is an example of our coding test, meant to test the setup.

The real test will have the same setup, with the same files and filenames and so on, but with different exercises.

You should be able to build and run the example code by executing the following command on your shell:

```
make
```

We've prepared two files:
- `task.h`: Includes descriptions of the programming tasks and some boilderplate functions.
- `task_test.cpp`: This is used to test the correctness of the functions defined in `task.h`.

Please let us know if you run into problems building the provided boilerplate on your system, we are happy to provide a shared environment for you to work on this task. Feel free to use your own IDE and build system, by starting a new project with `task.h` and `task_test.cpp` if you feel more comfortable with it.
