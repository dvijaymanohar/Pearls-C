# Terminology

## Airfoil geometry

The airfoil geometry refers to the shape of the airfoil, which is crucial for generating lift using the Bernoulli equation. The shape of an airfoil is designed such that it is curved on the top and flat on the bottom. This causes the air moving over the top of the airfoil to travel faster than the air moving underneath, creating a pressure differential. This pressure differential creates lift on the airfoil. The exact geometry of the airfoil is defined by various parameters, such as the thickness and curvature of the airfoil, which are used to design airfoils for specific applications.

### Airfoil - Angle of attack

The angle of attack (AoA) is the angle between the oncoming flow direction of a fluid (such as air) and a reference line on the airfoil. The reference line is typically the chord line of the airfoil, which is a straight line connecting the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil. The angle of attack is an important parameter in aerodynamics as it affects the lift and drag characteristics of an airfoil.

### Airfoil - Camber

Camber in airfoil geometry refers to the curvature of the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. It is the measure of the asy
mmetry of the airfoil from its chord line. The camber line is a curve that runs halfway between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil and is used as a reference line. The camber is usually expressed as a percentage of the chord length and can be either positive (meaning the airfoil has a curved upper surface and a flat lower surface) or negative (meaning the airfoil has a curved lower surface and a flat upper surface). The amount of camber affects the lift and drag characteristics of the airfoil.

## Lift Coefficient

In the context of the Bernoulli equation applied to the lift generation of an airfoil, the lift coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of the lift force generated by the airfoil to the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around it. It is denoted by the symbol C_L and is one of the key parameters used to characterize the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil. The lift coefficient depends on several factors, including the geometry of the airfoil, the fluid density and velocity, and the angle of attack of the airfoil with respect to the incoming flow.

## Pitot tube parameters

The Pitot tube is a device used to measure the velocity of a fluid flow in a pipe or a duct. It consists of a tube pointed directly into the fluid flow, with a second tube connected to a pressure gauge or transducer. The various parameters of a Pitot tube include:

**Velocity pressure**: The difference between the stagnation pressure (pressure measured at the tip of the tube) and the static pressure (pressure measured through the side holes of the tube).
Static pressure: The pressure of the fluid at rest.
Stagnation pressure: The pressure measured at the tip of the tube where the fluid flow is at a maximum velocity and zero pressure.
Total pressure: The sum of stagnation pressure and static pressure.
Angle of incidence: The angle at which the Pitot tube is inserted into the fluid flow.

**Diameter of the tube**: The diameter of the Pitot tube affects the velocity pressure and the response time of the gauge.
Temperature: The temperature of the fluid affects the density and viscosity of the fluid, which in turn affects the velocity measurement.

## Unifom distribution

A uniform distribution is a probability distribution where every possible value within a given range has an equal chance of being selected. In other words, the probability of selecting a specific value within the range is proportional to the range width. A uniform distribution is often used when the value of the quantity being modeled is unknown, and there is no reason to assume that any value is more likely than any other value. For example, rolling a fair six-sided die is an example of a uniform distribution since each possible outcome has an equal chance of occurring. The probability density function for a uniform distribution is constant within the range and zero outside the range.

## Non-Uniform distribution

A non-uniform empirical distribution is a type of probability distribution that is based on observed data, rather than on a mathematical formula. It describes the frequency or likelihood of different values or ranges of values that a variable may take, based on data that has been collected or observed. Non-uniform empirical distributions can take many forms, such as histograms, frequency tables, or cumulative distribution functions, and can be used to model a wide range of real-world phenomena in fields such as economics, finance, biology, and physics. Unlike uniform distributions, which assume that all values within a range are equally likely, non-uniform empirical distributions can have varying probabilities for different values or ranges of values, based on the data used to construct them.

## Data uncertainties

Data uncertainties refer to the extent to which data is incomplete, imprecise, or uncertain. In other words, it refers to the degree of confidence or trust we have in the data and the accuracy of the information it contains. There are different types of data uncertainties, including:

Measurement uncertainty: This occurs when there is a lack of accuracy or precision in the measurement process, leading to errors in the data.

Sampling uncertainty: This occurs when the sample used to collect data is not representative of the population, leading to biased results.

Model uncertainty: This occurs when the mathematical or statistical model used to analyze the data is not an accurate representation of the real-world situation.

Data processing uncertainty: This occurs when errors or inconsistencies are introduced during the data processing phase, such as during data cleaning, transformation, or integration.

Natural variability: This occurs when there is inherent variability or randomness in the system being studied, leading to uncertainty in the data.

Overall, data uncertainties are an important consideration when interpreting and analyzing data, as they can affect the validity and reliability of the results. It is important to quantify and communicate these uncertainties to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the data are accurate and trustworthy.

## Uncertainty tracking

Uncertainty-tracking computing platform is a type of software or platform that enables tracking and management of uncertainty in scientific and engineering computations. It is commonly used in fields such as physics, engineering, and statistics, where accurate calculations of uncertain values are essential.

These platforms typically use probabilistic methods to quantify the uncertainty in calculations, allowing for better decision-making and risk analysis. They may include tools for sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation of models, as well as visualization and reporting of results.

Uncertainty-tracking computing platforms can be used to model complex systems and processes, such as weather forecasting, financial risk analysis, and medical diagnosis. They are often used in conjunction with other modeling and simulation tools to provide a more complete understanding of the behavior of a system.
Overall, uncertainty-tracking computing platforms are an important tool for scientists and engineers who need to make accurate predictions and decisions in the presence of uncertainty.
