Mathematical formula and algorithm for the Bernoulli equation model of lift generation of an airfoil.

To calculate the lift force, we need to use a formula that takes into account all these parameters. Here's a simplified version of the lift force formula:

> L = 0.5 \* rho \* V^2 \* Cl \* A

where L is the lift force, rho is the air density, V is the air velocity, Cl is the lift coefficient, and A is the reference area of the airfoil.

To calculate the air velocity, we can use the Pitot tube, which measures the total pressure of the fluid flow. The static pressure can be obtained separately by measuring the pressure at a point on the airfoil where the fluid is not moving. The difference between the total and static pressure gives us the dynamic pressure, which can be used to calculate the air velocity using the Bernoulli equation.

For the air density, we need to take into account factors such as temperature, humidity, and elevation. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate the air density as a function of these factors.

To introduce measurement uncertainties into the model, we can use non-uniform empirical distributions for each parameter. For example, we can use statistical data on temperature and humidity to determine a probability distribution for the air density. Similarly, we can use wind speed measurements to determine a probability distribution for the air velocity.

Implementing these formulas and probability distributions in C code will require careful programming and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. It's recommended to work with experienced engineers and programmers to develop and validate such a complex model.
